= Introduction

This is a simple gem for Ruby that simplifies validating email addresses. It conforms with RFC2822.

Here comes a quick code sample. Currently no docs.

  require 'rfc822'

  # To test if whole string is an email... ugly way 
  #  (returns 0 on success, nil on failure):

  "tom@example.com".dup.force_encoding("BINARY") =~ RFC822::EMAIL_REGEXP_WHOLE

  # or nice one (returns true/false):

  "tom@example.com".is_email?


  
  # To test if string contains an email... ugly way 
  #   (returns 0 on success, nil on failure):
  
  "demo john@example.comFooBar".dup.force_encoding("BINARY") =~ RFC822::EMAIL_REGEXP_PART

  # or nice one (returns true/false):

  "demo john@example.comFooBar".contains_email?



  # To scan for emails within a string... ugly way 
  #   (returns an array):
  
  "something a@example.com xyz".dup.force_encoding("BINARY").scan(RFC822::EMAIL_REGEXP_PART)

  # or nice one (also returns an array):

  "something a@example.com xyz".scan_for_emails

If you omit `.dup.force_encoding("BINARY")` part, you can run into exceptions if someone passes non-ASCII email (see https://github.com/mspanc/rfc822/issues/3).
